          <p>
            The PanDao platform enables users to create and deploy their own
            Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) governed by users,
            using code-based smart contracts on blockchain.
          </p>

            To use PanDao, you may use non-custodial wallet software, which
            allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your use of a
            non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of
            service of that third party, and are not governed by these Terms.
          </p>

              ASSETS. YOU SHOULD CONDUCT YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND SEEK
              PROFESSIONAL ADVICE BEFORE USING PANDAO. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">Risks</h3>
          <p>
            By accessing and using PanDao, you represent that you understand the
            financially and technically risks associated with using
            cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, including, to the extent
            that:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-10 flex flex-col gap-1">
            <li>
              You understand that the markets for these digital assets are
              nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including, but not
              limited to, adoption, speculation, technology, security, and
              regulation.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand that anyone can create fake versions of existing
              tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent DAOs, projects,
              and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade
              those or other tokens.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand that smart contract transactions automatically
              execute and settle, and that blockchain-based transactions are
              irreversible when confirmed.
            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting
              with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Radix are
              variable and may increase dramatically at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these
              variables or risks, do not own or control the protocol, and cannot
              be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while
              accessing or using PanDao.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of
              the risks of accessing and using PanDao.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand that we do not own or control any of the underlying
              software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general,
              the software underlying blockchain networks, including the
              Ethereum blockchain, is open source, such that anyone can use,
              copy, modify, and distribute it.
            </li>
            <li>
              By using PanDao, you acknowledge and agree, that: PanDao is not
              responsible for the operation of the blockchain-based software and
              networks underlying the PanDao platform; that there exists no
              guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that
              software and networks, and the underlying blockchain-based
              networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as
              those commonly referred to as “forks,” which may materially affect
              PanDao.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand that blockchain networks use public and private key
              cryptography.
            </li>
            <li>
              You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do
              not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your
              private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access
              to digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain or other blockchain
              based network. If your private key(s) are lost, then you will not
              be able to transfer your digital assets to any other blockchain
              address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to
              realize any value or utility from the digital assets that you may
              hold.

              actions, which could impede or limit the ability to continue

            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Ethereum
              blockchain is variable and may increase at any time causing impact
              to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain, which
              may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using
              PanDao.

            <li>
              You use PanDao at your own risk. You acknowledge that PanDao is
